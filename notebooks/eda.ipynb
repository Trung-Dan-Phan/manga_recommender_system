Bearer of a gigantic sword, an iron hand, and the scars of countless battles and tortures, his flesh is also indelibly marked with The Brand, an unholy symbol that draws the forces of darkness to him and dooms him as their sacrifice. But Guts won't take his fate lying down; he'll cut a crimson swath of carnage through the ranks of the damned—and anyone else foolish enough to oppose him! Accompanied by Puck the Elf, more an annoyance than a companion, Guts relentlessly follows a dark, bloodstained path that leads only to death...or vengeance.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Dark Horse)<br>\n<br>\n<i>Notes:<br>\n- Volumes 1-5 contain the 16 prequel chapters 0A - 0P.<br>\n- <a href=\"https://anilist.co/manga/95821/\">Chapter 83</a> was omitted from Volume 13 due to the author’s request.<br>\n- Volume 14 includes “<a href=\"https://anilist.co/manga/36408/\">Berserk: The Prototype</a>”.<br>\n- Due to the author's passing, starting from Chapter 365, the manga is illustrated by Studio Gaga (Miura's assistants) and supervised by Kouji Mori (a close friend of Miura's).</i>",

Constantly running errands and being beaten up by his classmates, Ippo has always dreamed of changing himself, but never has the passion to act upon it. One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to Takamura boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo&rsquo;s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit. Thus Ippo&rsquo;s journey to the top of the boxing world begins.<br><br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

Her laziness at school is due to her love for anime and video games and lack of interest in anything else. The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara.

Unfortunately, his only option is the cool and sexy Akihiko Usami. Usami happens to be a famous boys&rsquo; love novelist, which doesn&rsquo;t exactly float Misaki&rsquo;s boat, especially since his main characters are &ldquo;Akihiko&rdquo; and &ldquo;Takahiro,&rdquo; the name of Misaki&rsquo;s older brother and Usami&rsquo;s childhood friend. Understandably, Misaki is pretty disgusted by the thought of someone using his older brother as his personal fantasy-material, but then after some tender loving from Usami, Misaki is also pretty confused. He may even be developing feelings for the older man...And when Takahiro introduces them to his lovely (female) fianc&eacute;e, so begins the bumpy relationship of this odd couple, filled with comedy and pure romance.<br><br>\n<b>Junjou Egoist</b><br>\nKamijou Hiroki is a broken man, consumed by unrequited love for his childhood friend, Usami Akihiko (the writer character in Junjou Romantica).  Along comes Kusama Nowaki, whose name \"Nowaki\" means \"typhoon\", an orphan working his way through life since middle school.  Like the typhoon he is named for, he whirls into Hiroki's life and heart, blowing all resistance away before him.<br><br>\n<b>Junjou Terrorist</b><br>\nAs fate would have it,  Professor Miyagi Yoh (whom Hiroki is working with as assistant professor), and Takatsuki Shinobu, a high school student, cross paths.  Miyagi, when in high school, loved (and still cannot forget) a female teacher who had a terminal illness, is now faced with Shinobu, who just says whatever is on his mind. The wheel of destiny is beginning to turn once again...<br><br>\n<i>Note: Includes a short story called Junjou Minimum</i>",
